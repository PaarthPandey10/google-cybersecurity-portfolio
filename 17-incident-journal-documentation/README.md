# Incident Handler Journal – Practical SOC Analyst Tasks

> Logged and documented real-world SOC analyst simulations across 8 hands-on activities including malware analysis, IDS tuning, and SIEM exploration.

---

## Overview

This project serves as a consolidated **incident handler journal** capturing all SOC analyst tasks performed across various labs and scenarios. From malware analysis and phishing alert resolution to IDS rule configuration and SIEM data querying, each entry documents the process, findings, tools used, and escalation decisions.

---

## Key Highlights

- **Total Entries**: `8`

- **Tools Covered**:
  - `VirusTotal`, `Suricata`, `Splunk`, `Alert Ticket System`, `Incident Playbooks`

- **Topics Documented**:
  - **Credential dumping** detection using XDR solutions.
  - **Phishing email investigation** and malicious payload tracing.
  - **Custom IDS rule creation** in Suricata and alert review via `fast.log` and `eve.json`.
  - **Log analysis in Splunk** to identify failed SSH logins and potential root compromises.
  - **Final report review** of a million-record data breach to extract lessons and recommendations.

- **Notable Entry Example**:
  - Entry #5: Simulated credential dumping through a phishing attachment, verified indicators, and escalated based on policy triggers.

## Takeaway

Maintaining an incident handler journal is essential for structured learning and reflective practice. This log represents a progressive **build-up of SOC analyst competencies** through hands-on lab work and guided investigation exercises.
