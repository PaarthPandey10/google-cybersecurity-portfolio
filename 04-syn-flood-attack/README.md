# SYN Flood Attack Simulation

> Analysis of abnormal SYN packet traffic used to disrupt server access.

---

## Overview

This document summarizes the analysis of a SYN flood attack that targeted a travel agency’s web server. Using packet sniffing, the activity identifies an overwhelming number of TCP SYN requests from a malicious IP and documents the immediate response and mitigation efforts.

---

## Key Highlights

- Detected TCP SYN flood attack using packet capture tools.
- Analyzed attack effects including server unresponsiveness and timeouts.
- Blocked malicious IP using firewall rules as a temporary mitigation step.
- Emphasized limitations of IP blocking due to spoofing and the need for advanced protection.
