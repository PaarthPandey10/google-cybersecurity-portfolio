# Classify Home Network Assets

> Identifying, evaluating, and classifying devices on a home office network for improved cybersecurity asset management.

## Overview

This project demonstrates the process of creating an asset inventory for a home office network as part of cybersecurity asset management. I identified devices connected to the network, analyzed their network behavior, ownership, and physical location, and classified each based on its sensitivity and potential security risks.

This simulates a real-world cybersecurity task where knowing what assets exist — and how critical they are — helps prioritize protection and incident response efforts.

## Key Highlights

- Identified 3 additional home network devices: Smart TV, External Hard Drive, and Work Laptop.
- Documented characteristics including network access frequency, ownership, and physical location.
- Evaluated each device for its risk level based on the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data.
- Classified each asset using standard sensitivity categories: Confidential, Restricted, and Internal-only.
