# Analyze a Data Leak Incident and Recommend Least Privilege Controls

> Investigating a real-world-inspired data leak scenario and applying NIST SP 800-53 (AC-6) least privilege principles to improve information access control.

---

## Overview

This project focuses on a simulated data leak incident at a company where sensitive internal documents were unintentionally shared externally. By analyzing the events and applying guidance from NIST SP 800-53, particularly control AC-6 (Least Privilege), I recommended actionable improvements to reduce the likelihood of similar incidents in the future. This exercise demonstrates the practical application of access control strategies within the NIST Cybersecurity Framework.

## Key Highlights

- Investigated a data leak caused by accidental sharing of internal resources with external stakeholders.
- Identified control weaknesses in access management and user privilege policies.
- Applied **NIST SP 800-53 AC-6** to suggest improved implementation of the **least privilege** principle.
- Mapped the incident to the **Protect (PR)** function of the NIST CSF, specifically category **PR.DS: Data Security**, subcategory **PR.DS-5**.
- Recommended controls included:
  - Restrict access based on user roles.
  - Automatically revoke expired permissions.
  - Audit access privileges regularly.

## Takeaway

This activity reinforces the importance of role-based access, timely privilege revocation, and regular audits in preventing accidental data disclosures. Implementing least privilege effectively not only limits damage from user errors but also strengthens organizational data privacy.
