# Apply Filters to SQL Queries

> Using SQL logical operators to filter and retrieve data for cybersecurity investigations and system updates.

---

## Overview

This project demonstrates the use of SQL to extract specific information from organizational databases using complex filter conditions. By leveraging `AND`, `OR`, `NOT`, and `LIKE` operators, I retrieved failed login attempts, filtered records by date and country, and isolated employee data based on department and office location. These queries simulate real-world scenarios where precise data retrieval is essential for incident response and IT management.

## Key Highlights

- Retrieved failed login attempts after business hours using `AND`.
- Filtered login attempts on specific suspicious dates using `OR`.
- Excluded login attempts originating from Mexico using `NOT LIKE 'MEX%'`.
- Queried employees in the Marketing department located in the East building.
- Identified employees from either the Finance or Sales department.
- Retrieved employee records excluding those in the Information Technology department.
