# Perform a Cybersecurity Risk Assessment

> Evaluating and prioritizing potential security risks using the NIST Cybersecurity Framework to improve an organization’s risk posture.

---

## Overview

This project demonstrates the process of conducting a risk assessment for a commercial bank as part of its cybersecurity planning. Using a risk register, I identified and analyzed potential vulnerabilities, scored their likelihood and severity, and prioritized them based on risk impact. This simulated a real-world application of the NIST Cybersecurity Framework to support proactive threat mitigation.

## Key Highlights

- Assessed five major risks: Business Email Compromise, Compromised User Database, Financial Records Leak, Theft, and Supply Chain Disruption.
- Scored each risk based on likelihood and severity using a 1–3 scale.
- Calculated risk priority using the formula: **Likelihood × Severity = Risk Score**.
- Produced a prioritized risk register to help security teams allocate resources effectively.
- Considered the operational environment, including employee count, customer base, and geographic threats.
