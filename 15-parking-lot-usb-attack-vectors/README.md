# USB Baiting Scenario – Rhetorical Hospital Parking Lot Incident

> Investigating the risks and attack vectors of a suspicious USB found in a hospital parking lot and evaluating safe handling and mitigation practices.

---

## Overview

This project simulates a common **USB baiting attack**, where a USB stick is strategically placed to exploit human curiosity. In the scenario, a USB with the hospital's logo was found in a parking lot. I conducted a content review and analyzed how such a device could be weaponized to compromise individual users and the broader organization.

## Key Highlights

- **Files Found**:
  - Work-related documents: shift schedules, employee budgets, resumes, and onboarding letters.
  - Personal files: wedding plans, family photos, vacation ideas.
  - Multiple files contained **PII** and **sensitive business information**.

- **Attack Vector**:
  - Information could be weaponized by attackers to **phish, impersonate, or socially engineer** employees.
  - Malware planted on the USB could lead to **network infiltration, data theft**, or **ransomware incidents**.

- **Security Recommendations**:
  - Always inspect unknown USBs in **virtualized or sandboxed environments**.
  - Apply **technical protections** like endpoint scanning and USB port restrictions.
  - Educate staff about **social engineering tactics** like USB baiting.
  - Avoid mixing personal and work data on the same device.

## Takeaway

This activity emphasizes how a small, seemingly harmless device like a USB can become a **serious threat vector**. Organizations must train employees, set clear handling protocols, and deploy technical defenses to reduce the risk of data breaches caused by curiosity or poor device hygiene.
