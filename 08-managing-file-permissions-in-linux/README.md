# Linux File Permissions Management

> Managing and securing file and directory permissions in Linux to enforce proper authorization.

---

## Overview

This project demonstrates the use of Linux Bash commands to examine and modify file and directory permissions under the `/home/researcher2/projects` directory. The goal is to ensure that permissions align with the principle of least privilege, restricting unauthorized access for users outside the intended group and owner. It covers checking permissions, changing file permissions (including hidden files), and adjusting directory permissions.

## Key Highlights

- Explored file and directory permissions using `ls -l` and `ls -la`.
- Identified and removed write permissions for “others” on files.
- Restricted group access to sensitive files.
- Secured hidden files by removing unnecessary write permissions.
- Restricted directory access so only the owner can access sensitive folders.
